Notes of things to be done before this branch can be released

* Bugs from sf.net

  See: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=432505&group_id=42250&func=browse

* Postgres

** CTT_MARKED_DELETED_I
   Performance improved significantly after dropping this index on Oracle 
   (@ 330k Rows in ci_content). One should check how Postgres behaves 
   after the NULL -> 0 switch.
