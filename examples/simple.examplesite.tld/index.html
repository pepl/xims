        <h1>Welcome to Grey Dahut Preservation Initiative (GDPI)</h1>
        <p>The GDPI aims to the preserve the endagered population and habitat of the Grey Dahut.</p>
        <p>In contrast to regular Dahuts, Grey Dahuts have been far more radically decimated in the Great Hunts of the late 20th century because of their easy to spot grey-colored fur in the electronic-snow covered glaciers of the virtual alps.</p>
        <p>The GDPI has already successfully started repopulation and is still heavily working on further progress.</p>
        <p>For details about the GDPI and to learn how to participate or contribute, visit the <a href="about.html">About Page</a>.
