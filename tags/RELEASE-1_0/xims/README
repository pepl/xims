Overview
--------
XIMS (eXtensible Information Management System) is a web-based
content management system. It provides features such as a flexible
recursive role and ACL system for securing content, the possibility
to "skin" the management interface and content using XSL stylesheets,
extensibility through user-defined object types.

of HTMLArea, support for other WYSIWYG-Editors like BXE, TinyMCE, and Xinha, new
object types, better support for web portal management, user interface updates and
