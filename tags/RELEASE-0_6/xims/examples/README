Example Sites
-------------

This example sites should give an idea how to build sites with XIMS. The
"Building Sites with XIMS" documents will give detailed step-by-step
introductions.

The example sites in that directory will each have three files for
importing, publishing, and configuring the site as well as the actual
content including CSS- and XSL-Stylesheets in a separate directory.

In the case of simple.examplesite.tld it looks like that:
¦   import_publish-simple.examplesite.tld.sh # Script that calls several
¦                                              scripts in the tools
¦                                              directory to import, publish,
¦                                              and assign departmentlinks.
¦
¦   simple.examplesite.tld-httpd.conf        # Sample vhost configuration
¦
¦   simple.examplesite.tld-axkit.conf        # AxKit configuration, included
¦                                              by the vhost configuration

            default.xsl       # Example stylesheet including some rather
                              # generic templates which would be moved
                              # to a common.xsl in more complex sites
                              # with other stylesheets like a textonly-,
                              # or print-version.
