This is XIMS, version 0.1.1.

Overview
--------
XIMS (eXtensible Information Management System) is a web-based
content management system. It provides features such as a flexible
recursive role and ACL system for securing content, the possibility
to "skin" the management interface and content using XSL stylesheets,
extensibility through user-defined object types.
For more information visit http://xims.uibk.ac.at/xims-info/.

XIMS operates in an Apache/CGI::XMLApplication/AxKit environment, and
uses the PostgreSQL or Oracle RDBMS for its data repository.

Note: Documentation is currently quite rudimentary :-/.


Release Notes
-------------
Keep it mind that this is an early XIMS package.
For the next packages we are planning to address at least the
following issues:

* Finish the UI and Homepage redesign
* Add/Update documentation!
* Add HTMLArea-Editor customizations (object browser for links and images, table plugin, ...)
* Add Bitflux-Editor integration
* Update acceptance tests for the test suite
* Start with user preferences (skin, ui-language, editor-preference, ...)

Other issues to be adressed include the following:

* Importer for filesystem objects
* SQL queries and data retrieval in general is not performance but
  genericity optimized - Work on that.
* Start with bigger things like Versioning and Multilanguage Content UI
