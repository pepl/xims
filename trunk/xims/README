This is XIMS, version 0.7.

Overview
--------
XIMS (eXtensible Information Management System) is a web-based
content management system. It provides features such as a flexible
recursive role and ACL system for securing content, the possibility
to "skin" the management interface and content using XSL stylesheets,
extensibility through user-defined object types.
For more information visit http://xims.info/

XIMS operates in an Apache/CGI::XMLApplication/AxKit environment, and
uses the PostgreSQL or Oracle RDBMS for its data repository.

Release Notes
-------------
This is a minor feature and bug fix release. For a detailed list of changes
review the "Changes" file.

For the next packages we are planning to add a "Virtual Library" module and
to address the following issues:

* Add/Update documentation!
* Add HTMLArea-Editor customizations (object browser for links and images, table plugin, ...)
* Update acceptance tests for the test suite
* Start with user preferences (skin, ui-language, editor-preference, ...)

Other issues to be adressed include the following:

* Start with multilanguage content user interface and versioning
* SQL queries and data retrieval in general is not performance but
  genericity optimized - work on that.

More issues can be found at the TODO at

Known Issues
------------

Using PostgreSQL 7.3.x, siblings will not be sorted by position in the
treeview event as they should be. PostgreSQL >= 7.4 fixes this behaviour.
