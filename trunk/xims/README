Release Notes
-------------
This is a bug fix release correcting wrong object privileges introduced with release 0.8, which
resulted into users not having CREATE privileges where they have been given grants using the
pseudo privilege MODIFY.

It is recommended to update to this release 0.9.1 to fix the privileges on existing objects
and take advantage of the new COPY privilege.


Changes
-------
See the file "Changes"


Known Issues
------------

Using PostgreSQL 7.3.x, siblings will not be sorted by position in the
treeview event as they should be. PostgreSQL >= 7.4 fixes this behaviour.
