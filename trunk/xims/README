This is XIMS, version 0.1 (beta).

Overview
--------
XIMS (eXtensible Information Management System) is a web-based
content management system. It provides features such as a flexible
recursive role and ACL system for securing content, the possibility
to "skin" the management interface and content using XSL stylesheets,
extensibility through user-defined object types.
For more information visit http://xims.uibk.ac.at/xims-info/.

XIMS operates in an Apache/CGI::XMLApplication/AxKit environment, and
uses the PostgreSQL or Oracle RDBMS for its data repository.

Installation

"INSTALL".


Documentation
-------------
At $ximsdir/doc and http://xims.uibk.ac.at/xims-doku/ you will find
XIMS documentation for users, developers, and system administrators.
Note: Documentation is currently quite rudimentary :-/.


Release Notes
-------------
Keep it mind that this is an early XIMS package, it is BETA.
For the next beta releases we are planning to adress at least the
following issues:

* Finish the UI redesign
* Add/Update documentation!
* Update acceptance tests for the test suite
* stylesheets for published docbook-objects
* Take care of XIMS Logo

Other issues to be adressed include the following:

* Importer for filesystem objects
* SQL queries and data retrieval in general is not performance but
  genericity optimized - Work on that.
* Start with user preferences (skin, ui-language, editor-preference, ...)
* Start with bigger things like Versioning and Multilanguage Content UI

Until user-start-pages are implemented, admins have to know the URL
for the user management interface. It is http://yourbox/goxims/users

More issues can be found at the TODO at
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=432919&group_id=42250&func=browse

This is an early development version of XIMS.
Production use is NOT recommended!

(If you can't wait to use XIMS for your site in a production environment
and are interested in the old Oracle-tied version of XIMS which has been
running in an production environment at the University of Innsbruck
since April 2002 without any troubles, please contact us.)
