XIMS Installation Guide
-----------------------------------

0) The following basic prerequisites need to be installed and working:
    * Apache 1.3.x with mod_perl 1.2x
      (See http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html if you do
      not already have it installed.

    * libxml2, libxslt (http://www.xmlsoft.org/),
      and Expat (http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/) C libraries

    * XIMS currently supports either
      Oracle (>=8.1.6) or PostgreSQL (>=7.2)
      as RDBMS backend. You need access to either one and have the
      respective client installed on your XIMS box. If you are using a
      PostgreSQL 7.2 database, you have to patch the XIMS database setup
      scripts to reflect the syntax changes between version 7.2 and 7.3.
      To do this, issue the following command after having unpacked the
      XIMS sources to /usr/local/xims:

      cd /usr/local/xims/patches/Pg7.2 && sh patch_to_7.2.sh

    * For database access using perl you'll need either
      DBD::Oracle or DBD::Pg installed.

1) Unpack the distribution to /usr/local:

    [root@host local]# cd /usr/local
    [root@host local]# tar xzpvf xims-pkg.tar.gz

2) Install the latest tidy binary (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy)

   Install it to /usr/local/bin/tidy. If you install it to another
   location, change /usr/local/xims/lib/XIMS/Object.pm line 845
   accordingly.

3) Check for module dependencies, set up database and
   basic configuration options, run the test suite.

    3.1) Update the location of the Perl binary in the Makefile if
         necessary

        [root@host local] cd xims && perl Makefile.PL

    3.2) Run make to check for Perl module dependencies

        [root@host xims] make

    3.3) Run make install to start XIMS installation

        [root@host xims] make install

        First, missing Perl modules will be installed using CPAN.pm.
        Depending on your already installed modules and the quality of
        the modules' setup scripts this is more or less likely to fail.
        If it does, it makes sense to retry "make install" one or two
        times since missing dependencies from the first run may be
        satisfied by then. If that also fails, you have to install the
        missing modules manually.
        After all module dependecies are satisified, XIMS module patches
        will be applied, followed by the XIMS database setup process.
        During that, you will be prompted for database connection
        information.
        Having successfully set up the XIMS database, the setup process
        will continue with the basic XIMS configuration, where you will
        be prompted to provide configuration information again. Note,
        that this will update the the most essential XIMS config options
        only. It is recommended to take a look at
        /usr/local/xims/lib/XIMS/Config.pm for further config
        customizations after finishing "make install".

    3.4) Run the test suite

        [root@host xims] make test

        If tests fail, take a look at the debug.log. If that does not
        help, feel free to contact us at the addresses quoted at the end
        of this document.

4) If the installation went fine so far, you now can fire up Apache and
    login to XIMS at http://host/goxims/defaultbookmark

Please actually read the file README.
