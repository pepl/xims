XIMS Installation Guide
-----------------------------------

0) The following basic prerequisites need to be installed and working:
    * Apache 1.3.x with mod_perl 1.2x
      (See http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html if you do
      not already have it installed.

    * libxml2, libxslt (http://www.xmlsoft.org/),
      and Expat (http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/) C libraries

      Note: Some parts of XML::LibXML (<= 1.56) break with libxml2 >= 2.6.0.
      Using XML::LibXML 1.57 and XML::LibXSLT 1.57 fixes this.

    * XIMS currently supports either
      Oracle (>=8.1.6) or PostgreSQL (>=7.3)
      as RDBMS backend. You need access to either one and have the
      respective client installed on your XIMS box.

      If you are using PostgreSQL, you have to have the tablefunctions in
      'contrib/tablefunc' installed.

      You can build and install them for your source build PostgreSQL version using
      'make' and 'make install' in your 'contrib/tablefunc' directory.
      If you are using a packaged version of PostgreSQL, you will very likely
      find a postgresql-contrib package for your distribution which you
      can install using your favourite package manager.

    * For database access using perl, you'll need either
      DBD::Oracle or DBD::Pg (>= 1.31) installed.

1) Unpack the distribution to /usr/local:

    [root@host local]# cd /usr/local
    [root@host local]# tar xzpvf xims-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    [root@host local]# ln -s xims-X.Y.Z xims

    X and Y represent the major and minor version numbers of your
    XIMS package.

    In case you are forced to install under a different path, say
    "/opt/webapps/" do the following:

        [root@host local]# cd /opt/webapps
        [root@host webapps]# tar xzpvf xims-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
        [root@host webapps]# ln -s xims-X.Y.Z xims

        Set the environment variable XIMS_HOME to "/opt/webapps/xims":

        [root@host local]# XIMS_HOME='/opt/webapps/xims';export XIMS_HOME

        if you have a sh-like shell (sh, ksh, bash, zsh) or

        [root@host local]# setenv XIMS_HOME '/opt/webapps/xims'

        on a csh-like shell (csh, tcsh).

2) Install the latest tidy binary (http://tidy.sourceforge.net/)

   Install it to /usr/local/bin/tidy. If you install it to another
   location, change the tidy settings during the installation process
   or afterwards in /usr/local/xims/lib/XIMS/Config.pm line 103 and 104
   accordingly.

3) Check for module dependencies, set up database and
   basic configuration options, run the test suite.

    3.1) Update the location of the Perl binary in the Makefile if
         necessary

        [root@host local] cd xims && perl Makefile.PL

    3.2) Run 'make' to check for Perl module dependencies

        [root@host xims] make

    3.3) Run 'make install' to start XIMS installation

        [root@host xims] make install

        First, missing Perl modules will be installed using CPAN.pm.
        Depending on your already installed modules and the quality of
        the modules' setup scripts this is more or less likely to fail.
        If it does, it makes sense to retry "make install" one or two
        times since missing dependencies from the first run may be
        satisfied by then. If that also fails, you have to install the
        missing modules manually.
        After all module dependecies are satisified, XIMS module patches
        will be applied, followed by the XIMS database setup process.
        During that, you will be prompted for database connection
        information.
        Having successfully set up the XIMS database, the setup process
        will continue with the basic XIMS configuration, where you will
        be prompted to provide configuration information again. Note,
        that this will update the the most essential XIMS config options
        only. It is recommended to take a look at
        /usr/local/xims/lib/XIMS/Config.pm for further config
        customizations after finishing "make install". For example,
        you could activate a WYSIWYG-Editor for editing documents there.

    3.4) (Re)start the apache server. Check if it prints warnings or errors.

    3.5) Run the test suite

        [root@host xims] make test

        If tests fail, check you testsuite config and|or take a look at
        the debug.log. If that does not help, feel free to contact us at
        the addresses quoted at the end of this document.

4) If the installation went fine so far, login to XIMS at
   http://host/goxims/user as user 'xgu' (pw: xgu) or user
   'admin' (pw: _adm1nXP).

5) Consult the documentation documents, e.g. "Building Sites with XIMS (Admin Guide)",
   for the next steps.

Please actually read the file README.
