* Install a recent, non-threading perl

  e.g. under /opt using perlbrew:

  $ sudo -s 
  # export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
  # curl -kL http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash
  # source ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/etc/bashrc
  # perlbrew available
  # perlbrew install perl-5.16.3 
  # perlbrew install-cpanm


* You will need a compiler along with libxml2, libxslt, expat and 
  their development files to build all perl dependencies.

* You also need 
  - HTML-Tidy (mandatory) 
  - htmldoc (for Questionaires) and 
  - Bibutils (for ReferenceLibraries)  


* Get XIMS, unpack under /opt/xims,
  review and edit /opt/xims/perl.deps, then

  # cpanm < /opt/xims/perl.deps

  Check whether everything went fine. 


  [Configuration, yadda, yadda, yadda]

* Review and edit ximsctl. It is prepared for the paths as used herein
  and starts a XIMS server listening on the loopback's port 5000.  

  ./etc/ contains example scripts as starting points for a deployment 
  along linux FHS conventions
