Example Sites
-------------

This example sites should give an idea how to build sites with XIMS. The
"Building Sites with XIMS" documents will give detailed step-by-step
introductions.

The example sites in that directory will each have three files for
importing, publishing, and configuring the site as well as the actual
content including CSS- and XSL-Stylesheets in a separate directory.

In the case of simple.examplesite.tld it looks like that:
|   setup-simple.examplesite.tld.pl          # Script that calls several
|                                            # scripts in the tools
|                                            # directory to import, publish,
|                                            # and assign departmentlinks
|                                            # as well as pubstylesheets.

|   simple.examplesite.tld-httpd.conf        # Sample vhost configuration
|                                            # Link or copy to your conf.d
|                                            # directory or Include it in
|                                            # your httpd.conf
|
|   simple.examplesite.tld-axkit.conf        # AxKit configuration, included
|                                              by the vhost configuration
