This is XIMS, version 0.9.

Overview
--------
XIMS (eXtensible Information Management System) is a web-based
content management system. It provides features such as a flexible
recursive role and ACL system for securing content, the possibility
to "skin" the management interface and content using XSL stylesheets,
extensibility through user-defined object types.

XIMS operates in an Apache/CGI::XMLApplication/AxKit environment, and
uses the PostgreSQL or Oracle RDBMS for its data repository.
