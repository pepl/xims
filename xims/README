This is XIMS, version 0.01 (alpha).

Overview
--------
XIMS (eXtensible Information Management System) is a web-based
content management system. It provides features such as a flexible
recursive role and ACL system for securing content, the possibility
to "skin" the management interface and content using XSL stylesheets,
extensibility through user-defined object types.
For more information visit http://xims.uibk.ac.at/xims-info/.

XIMS operates in an Apache/CGI::XMLApplication/AxKit environment, and
uses the PostgreSQL or Oracle RDBMS for its data repository.

"INSTALL".


Documentation
-------------
At $ximsdir/doc and http://xims.uibk.ac.at/xims-doku/ you will find
XIMS documentation for users, developers, and system administrators.
Note: Documentation is currently quite rudimentary :-/.


Release Notes
-------------
Keep it mind that this is the first ever XIMS package, it is alpha.
For the first beta release we are planning to
adress at least the following issues:

* Automation and simplification of the installation process
* UI consistency issues (finish the redesign, finish the stylesheet updates begun with folder|document_create.xsl)
* Add/Update documentation!
* Update acceptance tests for the test suite
* stylesheets for published docbook-objects
* Take care of XIMS Logo

Other issues to be adressed include the following:

* Importer for filesystem objects
* SQL queries and data retrieval in general is not performance but genericity
  optimized.
* Recursive application logic is used to retrieve hierarchical
  content data. To avoid that, it is planned to implement a concept
  similar to the "Nested Set Model of Trees in SQL" as described in
  Chapter 29 of Joe Celko's "SQL for Smarties" (a brief description
  of this concept can be found at
  http://www.dbmsmag.com/9603d06.html).
  Until that has not been implemented, the extra information used for
  discussion forum object types, like the timestamp of the child
  which has been last modified most recently for example, won't be
  made available.
* Rewrite XIMS::XSP
* Start with user preferences (skin, ui-language, editor-preference, ...)
* Start with bigger things like Versioning and Multilanguage Content UI

Until user-start-pages are implemented, admins have to know the URL
for the user management interface. It is http://yourbox/goxims/users

This is an early development version of XIMS.
